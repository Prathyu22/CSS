    <h1 style="color:blueviolet; font-size: 45px">What is CSS?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: sans-serif">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

    <h1 style="color:cornflowerblue; font-size: 45px">Why CSS?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: sans-serif">CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

    <h1 style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size: 45px">CSS Solved a Big Problem:</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: sans-serif">HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
        HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:        
        This is a heading        
        This is a paragraph.        
        When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.        
        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.        
        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
